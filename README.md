### INTRODUCTION
In today's interconnected world, computers play a pivotal role across diverse domains, revolutionizing aspects such as banking, online commerce, communication, education, research, and healthcare. To enhance medical practices and patient care, innovative technological solutions have emerged. Traditional X-ray scanners often produce indistinct images, posing a risk of misdiagnosis for bone fractures. To address this challenge, a comprehensive system has been developed, encompassing stages like pre-processing, edge detection, feature extraction, and machine learning classifications. The ultimate aim is to streamline the diagnostic process for surgeons. Using a dataset of 190 X-ray pictures, machine learning methods like SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, KNN, and Random Forest have been used for bone fracture identification. These algorithms' accuracy evaluations range from 0.62 to 0.94. Surprisingly, SVM has the best accuracy compared to most similar research. This statistical result, which reflects improvements in medical imaging analysis, highlights the potential of SVM in fracture identification.
